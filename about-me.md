Hi ... I'm Tanisha Sharma, a second-year BTech CSE student, exploring AI and web development.
I love learning new tools and getting hands-on with small projects.
I'm currently  grinding  on leetocode consistently to masterr DSA and mastering JAVA as well for backend
I want to join WTM to grow my tech skills, to contribute to an open source community, and collaborate with other learners.
